# MiniProject_AppstoreAnalysis

## About the dataset
The dataset used comprises of information of apps existing in Appstore. This is a little old dataset, definitely pre-covid. It comprises of the following columns:
'ID', 'Name', 'Subtitle', 'Average User Rating', 'User Rating Count', 'Price', 'In-app Purchases', 'Developer', 'Age Rating', 'Languages', 'Genres', 'Current Version Release Date', 'Original Release Date', 'DIFF', 'Grouped Genres', 'Total In-App Purchases', 'Sizes'.

## Aim
The main aim of this mini-project was not to just simply see which genres of apps have higher average user ratings, it was to see what would be the best combination strategy a developer could apply when developing an app of a particular genre. Example: If the developer wishes to develop an app of the 'Family' genre, in order to get user ratings of 4-and-above, he/she must include in-app-purchases in the range x-to-y and make sure that the size of the game is in the range a-to-b MBs.
